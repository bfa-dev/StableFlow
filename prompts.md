## 📋 Step-by-Step Cursor Prompts

### 🚀 Step 1: Project Setup & Infrastructure

**Prompt for Cursor:**
```
Create a NestJS monorepo project called "stableflow" that simulates a Tether-scale stablecoin platform. 

Requirements:
- Use NestJS CLI to create a monorepo structure
- Include these microservices as separate apps:
  1. api-gateway (main entry point)
  2. auth-service (JWT authentication & roles)
  3. wallet-service (balance management)
  4. transaction-service (mint/burn/transfer API)
  5. transaction-worker (Kafka consumer)
  6. audit-service (transaction logging)
  7. notification-service (alerts & webhooks)

- Create a docker-compose.yml with:
  - MySQL 8.0 for wallet data
  - MongoDB for audit logs
  - Redis for caching & sessions
  - Kafka + Zookeeper for message queuing
  - All services with proper networking

- Add proper TypeScript configuration
- Include .env templates for each service
- Add package.json scripts for running individual services
- Include Dockerfile for each service
```

### 🔐 Step 2: Authentication & Authorization Service

**Prompt for Cursor:**
```
Implement the auth-service with enterprise-grade authentication:

Features to implement:
- User registration with email/password
- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Role-based access control (USER, ADMIN, SUPER_ADMIN)
- API key authentication for service-to-service calls
- Rate limiting for auth endpoints
- Password strength validation
- Account lockout after failed attempts
- Audit logging for all auth events

Database schema (MySQL):
- users table: id, email, password_hash, role, status, created_at, updated_at
- user_sessions table: id, user_id, refresh_token, expires_at
- auth_attempts table: id, email, ip_address, success, attempted_at

Endpoints:
- POST /auth/register
- POST /auth/login
- POST /auth/refresh
- POST /auth/logout
- GET /auth/me
- POST /auth/change-password

Use bcrypt for password hashing, implement JWT with proper expiration, and add Swagger documentation.
```

### 💰 Step 3: Wallet Service

**Prompt for Cursor:**
```
Create the wallet-service that manages user balances and wallet operations:

Core functionality:
- Create wallets for new users
- Track USDT balances (use decimal type for precision)
- Handle wallet freezing/unfreezing (compliance)
- Generate wallet addresses (simulate crypto addresses)
- Balance history tracking
- Multi-currency support (USDT, USDC simulation)

Database schema (MySQL):
- wallets table: id, user_id, address, balance, frozen_balance, status, created_at
- balance_history table: id, wallet_id, old_balance, new_balance, change_type, created_at
- wallet_addresses table: id, wallet_id, currency, address, is_primary

Internal APIs (service-to-service):
- POST /internal/wallets/create
- GET /internal/wallets/balance/:userId
- POST /internal/wallets/update-balance
- POST /internal/wallets/freeze
- POST /internal/wallets/unfreeze

Public APIs:
- GET /wallets/my-wallet
- GET /wallets/balance-history
- POST /wallets/generate-address

Include proper error handling, transaction locks for balance updates, and audit logging.
```

### 🔄 Step 4: Transaction API Service

**Prompt for Cursor:**
```
Build the transaction-service that handles mint/burn/transfer requests:

Core operations:
- MINT: Create new USDT tokens (admin only)
- BURN: Destroy USDT tokens (admin/user)
- TRANSFER: Send tokens between users
- BULK_TRANSFER: Handle multiple transfers (admin)

Business rules:
- Only SUPER_ADMIN can mint tokens
- Users can only burn their own tokens
- Transfers require sufficient balance
- All operations must be auditable
- Implement daily/monthly limits per user
- Add transaction fees (configurable)

Database schema (MySQL):
- transactions table: id, type, from_user_id, to_user_id, amount, fee, status, created_at
- transaction_limits table: id, user_id, daily_limit, monthly_limit, current_daily, current_monthly

Endpoints:
- POST /transactions/mint (admin only)
- POST /transactions/burn
- POST /transactions/transfer
- POST /transactions/bulk-transfer (admin only)
- GET /transactions/history
- GET /transactions/limits

For each transaction:
1. Validate request and permissions
2. Check limits and balances
3. Create pending transaction record
4. Publish to Kafka topic "transaction-requests"
5. Return transaction ID to client

Add comprehensive input validation and rate limiting.
```

### ⚡ Step 5: Transaction Worker Service

**Prompt for Cursor:**
```
Create the transaction-worker service that processes transactions asynchronously:

Kafka consumer functionality:
- Subscribe to "transaction-requests" topic
- Process transactions in order with retry logic
- Handle transaction failures and dead letter queue
- Ensure exactly-once processing (idempotency)
- Update wallet balances atomically
- Send notifications on completion

Processing flow:
1. Consume message from Kafka
2. Validate transaction is still pending
3. For MINT: Update recipient balance
4. For BURN: Deduct from sender balance
5. For TRANSFER: Deduct from sender, add to recipient
6. Update transaction status to "completed" or "failed"
7. Publish audit event to "audit-events" topic
8. Send notification if configured

Error handling:
- Implement exponential backoff for retries
- Dead letter queue for failed transactions
- Transaction rollback on failures
- Detailed error logging with transaction context

Database operations:
- Use database transactions for atomicity
- Implement proper locking to prevent race conditions
- Update both wallet balances and transaction status together

Add metrics and monitoring for transaction processing times.
```
